### Predictive Analysis of Medical Costs
This project presents a detailed analysis of medical cost data, exploring factors like age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and region to uncover trends and correlations. Through extensive data preprocessing and feature encoding, various regression techniques are evaluated, including linear regression, ridge regression, random forest, gradient boosting, decision tree, and XGBoost. However, an artificial neural network (ANN) emerges as the most accurate predictive model. The ANN model is deployed to develop a user-friendly interface, enabling stakeholders to predict medical costs effectively. With its superior performance and practical application, this project offers valuable insights into healthcare cost dynamics and provides a robust solution for cost prediction in the medical domain.
